    <p >Hello, my name is Mohamed. I was born and raised in New York City. I am a rising senior at Brooklyn Technical High School where I major in Finance. My interest in Finance stems from my time interning at JP Morgan during my freshman
        year of high school. I gained lots of knowledge about various aspects of the financial world. I am also a beginner level programmer currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
